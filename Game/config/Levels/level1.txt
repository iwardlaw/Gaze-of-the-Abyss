# Level files rely on a strict format.
#
# The objective line must contain the word 'OBJECTIVE' followed by the
# objective type and either a numerical argument or the word 'ALL'. For
# example, this level's objective is to clear all objects, so the
# objective type is 'CLEAR', and the argument is 'ALL'; alternatively,
# the number '4' could appear after 'CLEAR', since there are four
# objects in the level. Note that the numerical argument may be less
# than the number of objects in the level; additionally, providing an
# 'ALL' argument for a 'KILL' objective will only count the number of
# enemies you list. THE NUMERICAL ARGUMENT (OR 'ALL') DOES NOT APPLY
# TO A 'BOSS' OBJECTIVE: THE WORD 'BOSS' SHOULD TERMINATE THE LINE. If
# the objective is 'BOSS', please only declare one boss object. You may
# elect not to include an objective, but doing so is currently the only
# way to advance through levels.
#
# Background music is specified on one or two lines, dependending on
# whether there are separate introduction and looping sections to the
# song. The (optional) intro section is specified by 'BGM_INTRO'
# followed by the song's filepath (from the project folder). The
# looping section is structured the same way, specified by 'BGM_LOOP'.
# Music is not required, but if there is only one file to play,
# it should be declared as a loop, as in 'level1.txt'.
#
# Level objects follow the format <resource ID> <num> <x> <y> <spread>.
# The coordinates are based on screen position, so negative Y values
# are higher, and positive ones are lower. Resource IDs must be strings
# in the 'constants.h' file. Any new objects should have IDs added to
# that file and factories added to 'Factory.h'.
#
# While the format of each line must be exact, the placement of lines
# may vary.
